## New features in C# 7.0

1. **`out` variables**
    - You can declare `out` values inline as arguments. [Reference](https://github.com/antonyjack/C---7.0/tree/master/Out-Enhancement)
2. **Tuples**
    - You can create lightweight, unnamed types that contain multiple public fields. [Reference](https://github.com/antonyjack/C---7.0/tree/master/Tuples-Enhancement)
3. **Discards**
    - Discards are temporary, write-only variables used in assignments when you don't care about the value assigned. `_`only means "discard this parameter" if you declare it and use it. [Reference](https://github.com/antonyjack/C---7.0/tree/master/Discards-Tuples)
4. **Pattern Matching**
    - You can create logic based on attribute type. [Reference](https://github.com/antonyjack/C---7.0/tree/master/Pattern-matching)
5. **`ref` locals and returns**
    - Method arguments and local variables can be references other storage. [Reference](https://github.com/antonyjack/C---7.0/tree/master/ReturnRef)

10. **Numeric literal syntax improvements**
